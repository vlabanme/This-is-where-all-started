Lesson 2:
For each next task crate separate method. Method input A = [1..N] , each element [-1000, 1000], N = 1..1000000, return:
1. Third element
2. First 3 elements (if no element return nil's [1, nil, nil])
3. Every second value
4. Divide array in blocks of 5, and return array of their SUM
5. Considering that array A contains an odd number of elements where one of them has no pair. For example A = [8,7,3,1,1,4,3,8,7], 4 has no pair. Return index of that value
